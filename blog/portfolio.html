          <p class="py-8 text-customBlack">
            Creating a portfolio website is an important step for any
            professional or aspiring developer to showcase themselves and their
            work online. It is a place where potential clients or employers can
            learn about skills, experiences, and projects. When implementing
            such a website, various factors need to be considered, such as
            design, navigation, and technical implementation. The goal of this
            project was to create a portfolio website that takes all of these
            important aspects into account and provides a professional
            presentation of the work.
          </p>

            alt=""
          />
          <p class="py-8 text-customBlack">
            To implement the portfolio website with different breakpoints, I
            went through a design process in Figma. I analyzed the requirements
            for the website, created the desktop design, set breakpoints, and
            adapted the design for the different breakpoints. This process
            ensured that my website is optimally displayed on any device.

          <h1 class="text-3xl font-medium text-customBlack">
            Software and tools
          </h1>

          <p class="py-8 text-customBlack">
            Various tools and software were used to implement the portfolio
            website. Visual Studio Code was used as the code editor, which
            offers many useful features for web development. The Tailwind CSS
            framework was used to create a custom design quickly and
            effectively. Figma was a useful tool for designing the website, and
            Git allowed for efficient management of code changes and integration
            of changes from other developers. Using these tools, the portfolio
            website was implemented quickly and effectively.

            <p class="py-6 text-customBlack">
              The implementation of a portfolio website requires careful
              consideration of various factors, such as design, navigation, and
              technical implementation. The use of tools such as Visual Studio
              Code, the Tailwind CSS Framework, Figma, and Git can greatly
              facilitate the process. When designing a website with different
              breakpoints, it is important to analyze the requirements, create a
              style guide, design for the desktop, set breakpoints, and adapt
              the design for each breakpoint. By following this process, a
              professional and user-friendly portfolio website can be created
              that showcases the developer's skills, experiences, and projects
              effectively.

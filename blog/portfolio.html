        <p class="py-8 text-customBlack">Creating a portfolio website is an important step for any professional or
          aspiring developer to showcase themselves and their work online. It is a place where potential clients or
          employers can learn about skills, experiences, and projects. When implementing such a website, various
          factors need to be considered, such as design, navigation, and technical implementation. The goal of this
          project was to create a portfolio website that takes all of these important aspects into account and provides
          a professional presentation of the work.</p>
        <img class="rounded-lg" src="../assets/img/portfolio/showcasePortfolio.png" alt="">
        <p class="py-8 text-customBlack">
          To implement the portfolio website with different breakpoints, I went through a design process in Figma. I
          analyzed the requirements for the website, created the desktop design, set breakpoints, and adapted the design
          for the different breakpoints. This process ensured that my website is optimally displayed on any device.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text-3xl font-medium text-customBlack">Software and tools</h1>

        <p class="py-8 text-customBlack">
          Various tools and software were used to implement the portfolio website. Visual Studio Code was used as the
          code editor, which offers many useful features for web development. The Tailwind CSS framework was used to
          create a custom design quickly and effectively. Figma was a useful tool for designing the website, and Git
          allowed for efficient management of code changes and integration of changes from other developers. Using these
          tools, the portfolio website was implemented quickly and effectively.

          <p class="py-6 text-customBlack">
            The implementation of a portfolio website requires careful consideration of various factors,
            such as design, navigation, and technical implementation. The use of tools such as Visual Studio Code, the
            Tailwind CSS Framework, Figma, and Git can greatly facilitate the process. When designing a website with
            different breakpoints, it is important to analyze the requirements, create a style guide, design for the
            desktop, set breakpoints, and adapt the design for each breakpoint. By following this process, a
            professional and user-friendly portfolio website can be created that showcases the developer's skills,
            experiences, and projects effectively.
